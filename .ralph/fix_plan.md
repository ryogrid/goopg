# goopg Fix Plan

The roadmap below is derived from `.ralph/specs/GOAL_AND_REQUIREMENTS.md`. The
"Definition of Done (Initial Milestone)" in §10 of the spec is the target;
items here decompose that target into agent-sized chunks. Pick the topmost
unchecked item unless a dependency forces a different order.

NOTE: past milestones are stored in `completed_milestones/` and should NOT be copied. If you need to reference a past milestone, you can see these files for the historical record, but they are not part of the active fix plan. Only items in this file are actionable.

Completed milestones are archived under `completed_milestones/` (latest: `completed_fix_plan_007.md`).

## Maintenance (small, do when convenient — does not preempt milestone order)

- [ ] **MAINT-TPCH-RELOAD** — Reload the TPC-H bench dataset so the silent-regression
      gate works again. `bench/tpch/runtime_goopg/data` is a stale husk (no PG_VERSION,
      last real load 2026-05-26), so `scripts/tpch-spotcheck.sh` currently SKIPs.
      Steps: run `bench/tpch/build_schema_goopg.sh` (capped via the wrapper), then run
      `scripts/tpch-spotcheck.sh`, and re-pin `Q13_EXPECTED` in
      `bench/tpch/spotcheck_expected.env` from the fresh load (Q13 is load-dependent;
      Q12 must be 2). DoD: spotcheck exits PASS and the env file cites the new run log.

## M0095 — Client-Tools TAP Test Porting (filed 2026-05-12)

Operational note (2026-05-12):
- Items that are blocked or can only be partially progressed due to missing goopg support must include blocker resolution within this milestone's scope.
- For items that can move forward once blockers are resolved, do not mark them complete until the resolution is implemented and re-verified.
- Only items that are impossible to resolve due to goopg's Go-implementation constraints or explicit design constraints may remain marked complete, and the reason must be documented.

Goal: Port the 27-file client-tools-tap suite to Go and implement the
missing engine features that currently hold ported scripts tests in a
`t.Skip` state.  The list spans five tool families:

  • `pg_basebackup` (010–040)  — WAL backup / receive / logical streaming
  • `pg_checksums`  (001–002)  — online/offline checksum management
  • `pg_controldata` (001)     — control-file inspection
  • `pg_ctl`        (001–004)  — **already PASS**; no new work needed
  • `pg_walsummary` (001–002)  — WAL summary generation
  • `scripts`       (13 files, 010–200) — client utility commands

`pg_ctl` 001–004 are already ported and PASS (`tap_port_test.go`).
All 13 scripts tests are already ported but remain `t.Skip` due to
missing SQL features; sub-milestones 0004–0008 implement those features.

### Sub-milestones

- [x] **M0095-0002**
      - Summary: Port `pg_walsummary/002` (WAL block summarization)
        as adapted Go test in `client_tools_port_test.go`.
      - Basic SQL (CREATE TABLE, INSERT, VACUUM, CHECKPOINT) passes.
      - WAL summarization (summarize_wal GUC, pg_available_wal_summaries(),
        pg_stat_io walsummarizer rows, pg_walsummary -i) deferred with explicit
        t.Skip blocker (goopg rejects unknown GUCs at startup; function not
        implemented). CSV row WS-002 added; markdown regenerated (2026-05-12).
      - **COMPLETE 2026-05-29 (M0095-0002):** t.Skip removed; test passes.
        Four changes closed all blockers:
        (a) `pg_stat_io` virtual table (`internal/catalog/catalog.go`): 20
            columns matching PG 16+ schema (backend_type, object, context,
            reads/read_bytes/read_time, writes/…, writebacks/…, extends/…,
            hits, evictions, reuses, fsyncs/fsync_time, stats_reset); OID 8061;
            VirtualRows returns nil (no I/O stats tracked in goopg v0).
        (b) `PgAvailableWalSummaries` plan node (`internal/planner/plan.go`):
            schema {tli int8, start_lsn pg_lsn, end_lsn pg_lsn}; cases added
            to FoldConstants and walkPlanExprs (no sub-expressions).
        (c) `planPgAvailableWalSummaries` + FROM whitelist (`internal/planner/planner.go`,
            `internal/parser/select.go`): planner routes `FROM
            pg_available_wal_summaries()` to the new plan node; parser FROM-clause
            SRF dispatch now includes `"pg_available_wal_summaries"` in its name
            switch so `pg_available_wal_summaries()` is parsed as a TableFuncRef.
        (d) `pgAvailableWalSummariesOp` executor (`internal/executor/operators_pg_available_wal_summaries.go`,
            `executor.go`): always returns 0 rows (no WAL summarizer in goopg v0).
        Test assertions: `SELECT count(*) FROM pg_available_wal_summaries()` = 0;
        `SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_io WHERE backend_type = 'walsummarizer'` = 0.
        `pg_walsummary -i` sub-case remains commented out (no summary files when
        `summarize_wal = off`). `TestPort_PgWalsummary002Blocks` → PASS.

- [ ] **M0095-0003**
      - Summary: Port `pg_basebackup/010`, `011`, `020`, `030`, `040`
        as adapted Go tests in `internal/testport/pgbasebackup_port_test.go`.
      - 010: --help/--version/options + no-pgdata + --compress=none:1/none+ PASS;
        backup execution PASS (2026-05-14, see below).
      - 011: SKIP entirely (in-place tablespace backup needs BASE_BACKUP protocol).
      - 020: --help/--version/options + no-dir + slot-conflict + sync-conflict + compress PASS;
        WAL streaming SKIP (replication protocol).
      - 030: --help/--version/options + no-slot/db/action/file checks PASS;
        logical streaming SKIP.
      - 040: --help/--version/options + no-datadir/publisher/database PASS;
        subscriber setup SKIP.
      - CSV rows BB-010..040 added; markdown regenerated (2026-05-12).
      - PROGRESS 2026-05-14: pg_basebackup `-X none --no-manifest --no-sync` now
        clones a live goopg primary end-to-end. New
        `TestPort_PgBasebackup010BackupExecution` drives the real
        `postgres/local_install/bin/pg_basebackup` binary against a fresh cluster
        and verifies extracted `backup_label`, `global/pg_control`, and
        `PG_VERSION`. Four discrete gaps closed (`docs/design/0095-0003-pg-basebackup-execution.md`):
        (a) `data_directory_mode` GUC (`internal/config/defaults.go`, BootVal=448 = 0o700)
            — `pg_basebackup` issues `SHOW data_directory_mode` early in its
            handshake and crashed with `unrecognized configuration parameter`.
        (b) `summarize_wal` GUC (BootVal=off, ContextSigHup) — same handshake
            wave; full WAL summarizer subsystem remains M0095-0002 scope.
        (c) `wal_segment_size` GUC as pre-formatted string `"16MB"` — naive
            `Type=TypeInt, Unit=UnitBytes` canonicalised to raw bytes
            `"16777216"` which pg_basebackup's `sscanf("%d%s")` rejected with
            "WAL segment size could not be parsed".
        (d) Trailing `CommandComplete("BASE_BACKUP")` in
            `internal/server/basebackup.go` — matches upstream's
            `EndReplicationCommand` wrap (`postgres/src/backend/tcop/dest.c:205`).
            Without it pg_basebackup's final `PQgetResult` returns NULL and
            surfaces as `"final receive failed: "` (empty error).
            `TestBaseBackupWireProtocolFraming` trailer assertion updated from
            4 frames (T/D/C/Z) to 5 frames (T/D/C/C/Z).
      - Verified: `go test -race ./internal/wal/ ./internal/mvcc/
        ./internal/executor/ ./internal/server/ ./internal/initdb/
        ./internal/config/` all green.
      - Action: extend coverage to `-X stream` once START_REPLICATION + walsender
        loop parity lands; add `--manifest` parity via `bbsink_manifest`
        emulation; M0095-0003 011/020 backup-execution branches and M0095-0003
        WAL streaming/recvlogical still require the same dependencies.

## M0096 — RC Isolation-Test Suite: Feature Implementation & Spec Pass (filed 2026-05-12)

Operational note (2026-05-12):
- Items that are blocked or can only be partially progressed due to missing goopg support must include blocker resolution within this milestone's scope.
- For items that can move forward once blockers are resolved, do not mark them complete until the resolution is implemented and re-verified.
- Only items that are impossible to resolve due to goopg's Go-implementation constraints or explicit design constraints may remain marked complete, and the reason must be documented.

Goal: Make all 21 READ-COMMITTED-targeted isolation specs listed in
`docs/test-port/executable-isolation-tests.md` PASS via
`IsolationRunner.RunAndCompare`.  All 21 currently defer (skip) inside
`TestPort_IsolationSuite`; they are the strongest proxy for goopg's
READ COMMITTED correctness story.

**Current blocker map** (21 specs → feature groups):

| Feature gap | Blocks |
|---|---|
| `BEGIN [WORK] ISOLATION LEVEL <level>` parser | all 21 (used in every session setup block) |
| `pg_advisory_lock / unlock / unlock_all / xact_lock / try_xact_lock` | `lock-committed-update`, `lock-committed-keyupdate`, `insert-conflict-specconflict` |
| `FOR KEY SHARE` / `FOR NO KEY UPDATE` locking syntax | `lock-committed-keyupdate`, `partition-key-update-1–4` |
| ON CONFLICT executor correctness (parser exists) | `insert-conflict-do-update` (1–4), `insert-conflict-do-nothing` |
| `CREATE TABLE … PARTITION BY LIST/RANGE` + `PARTITION OF` | `partition-key-update-1–4`, `fk-snapshot`, `merge-*`, `eval-plan-qual` |
| `GENERATED ALWAYS AS (expr) STORED` columns | `eval-plan-qual` |
| Table `INHERITS` | `eval-plan-qual`, `eval-plan-qual-trigger` |
| `MERGE INTO … USING … ON … WHEN MATCHED/NOT MATCHED` | `merge-update/delete/insert-update/match-recheck/join` (5 specs) |
| Inline `REFERENCES` FK column constraint (CREATE TABLE) | `partition-key-update-2/3/4`, `fk-snapshot` |
| `CREATE TRIGGER` + PL/pgSQL trigger bodies | `eval-plan-qual-trigger`, `partition-key-update-3/4`, `fk-snapshot` |
| `DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY` syntax | `drop-index-concurrently-1` |

Parallel-connection note: `TestPort_IsolationSuite` runs all specs with
`t.Parallel()` and many concurrently exhaust the server's connection
limit; dedicated sequential test functions (M0096-0001) are required
alongside the suite.

### Sub-milestones

- [ ] **M0096-0013**
      - Summary: End-to-end pass confirmation: run all 21 dedicated
        test functions from M0096-0001, confirm every spec reports `pass`.
      - Fix any remaining output-normalization or row-ordering mismatches.

      - **Status**: Partial — 0 of 21 tests fully pass (all report "defer").
      - Fixes landed:
      - Parser: `parseFKAction` now uses `acceptKeyword` (CASCADE/RESTRICT/SET
        are tokenized as keywords, not identifiers). Fixed `KwOn` in REFERENCES
        ON DELETE clause. Fixed bare `INITIALLY DEFERRED` (without DEFERRABLE).
      - Partition-aware DELETE: deleteOp scans partition/inheritance children.
      - Partition-aware UPDATE: updateOp scans children + routes new row to
        correct partition (cross-partition UPDATE). `remapRowForPartition` handles
        column-order differences (e.g. part2 in merge-update spec).
      - Remaining blockers (documented, not fixed in this loop):
      - RR/Serializable snapshot semantics: server refreshes snapshot per statement
        for all isolation levels; RR should use BEGIN-time snapshot.
      - Concurrent blocking detection: INSERT/UPDATE wait semantics and
        `<waiting ...>` output not produced for all cases.
      - RAISE NOTICE output: trigger functions produce no output (NOTICE is no-op).
      - Column alignment: `---+---` width varies between PostgreSQL and goopg.
      - EvalPlanQual: concurrent UPDATE re-evaluation not implemented.
      - Action: close the above blockers and rerun all 21 dedicated isolation tests
        until every case reaches pass.

## M0100 — RC Isolation Suite: Runtime Correctness Closure & 21-Spec Pass (filed 2026-05-13)

**【Strong policy — DO NOT BYPASS】**
Within this milestone, marking any sub-task as DEFERRED is, as a rule,
not permitted. Every item enumerated here is a residual runtime
correctness gap that must be closed to actually make the 21 RC
isolation tests pass; leaving any one of them unimplemented makes
M0100's Definition of Done unreachable. Escape hatches such as "push
it to the next milestone" or "punt to the next loop" must not be used.
DEFERRED is permitted only when **all three** of the following hold
simultaneously: (a) it is clearly demonstrated that the item is
impossible to implement in this release due to goopg's Go-implementation
constraints or explicit design constraints; (b) the reason is documented
in the body of the affected sub-milestone; and (c) within the same
milestone, an alternative path is presented that lets the corresponding
test(s) reach `pass` (not `excluded`). Deferring for any reason that
does not satisfy all three conditions is not allowed.

Operational note (2026-05-13):
- For items that can only be partially progressed due to an external blocker or missing goopg support, blocker resolution is itself in scope for this milestone.
- For items that can move forward once a blocker is resolved, do not mark them complete until the resolution is implemented and re-verified.

**Goal.** Make all 21 dedicated `TestPort_Isolation*` test functions
(added by M0096-0001) report `pass`. The parser/planner/catalog/DDL
surface landed across M0096-0002..-0012; what remains is runtime
correctness in the dispatcher, MVCC, and heap/DML operator path.
**Closes M0096-0005 and M0096-0013 via cross-reference at M0100-0005.**

Milestone doc: `docs/milestones/0100-rc-isolation-runtime-correctness-and-spec-pass.md`.

### Sub-milestones

- [x] **M0100-0001**
      - Summary: RR/Serializable BEGIN-time snapshot. (2026-05-13)
      - Design doc: `docs/design/0100-0001-isolation-level-snapshot-semantics.md`.
      - Implemented: dispatch.go line 295-300 gated on `ectx.Tx.Isolation ==
        IsolationReadCommitted` — RC refreshes per statement, RR/SSI keeps
        BEGIN-time snapshot. Uses ectx.Tx.Isolation (not outer tx variable) so
        execBegin's RR tx promotion is visible within multi-statement queries.
      - TestRepeatableReadPinsFirstSnapshot already covers MVCC layer.
      - All server/mvcc/executor tests pass with -race. Commit: ad82b12.

- [x] **M0100-0002**
      - Summary: Eager XID materialisation for ON CONFLICT wait
        propagation. **Closes M0096-0005.** (2026-05-13)
      - Design doc: `docs/design/0100-0002-eager-xid-materialization-at-begin.md` (accepted).
      - Implemented (5 logical areas):
        - 1. `mvcc/manager.go`: `IsXIDActive(xid)` public method; abortedXIDs tracking
          in `finish()` on rollback; `captureSnapshotLocked` includes all abortedXIDs
          in snapshot's `Aborted` field.
        - 2. `mvcc/snapshot.go`: `Aborted []TransactionID` field in Snapshot; `HasAborted(xid)`
          method; `SeesCommittedXID` checks `HasAborted` before xid < Xmin (fixes
          rolled-back rows appearing committed — lightweight clog substitute).
        - 3. `executor/operators_upsert.go`: `findInProgressConflict` uses `IsXIDActive`
          (not `Snap.HasInProgress`) so future-xmin tuples (materialized after snapshot)
          are detected; planner auto-detects primary key as arbiter for bare ON CONFLICT
          DO NOTHING in `planOnConflict`.
        - 4. `server/conn_tx.go`: `Tx()` returns session's current transaction (with
          up-to-date materialised XID) so session self-sees its own writes in SELECT
          after INSERT within the same explicit transaction.
        - 5. `testport/framework/isolation_runner.go`: per-permutation global setup/teardown
          (matches PostgreSQL isolationtester); pqprintFormat trailing blank line; step
          ordering fix (`drainWithTimeout` after each regular step).
      - Verified: `TestPort_IsolationInsertConflictDoNothing` → PASS.
      - All unit tests (mvcc/executor/server/planner) pass with -race.

- [x] **M0100-0003**
      - Summary: Row-level wait on in-progress xmax for UPDATE/DELETE. (2026-05-13)
      - Design doc: `docs/design/0100-0003-row-level-wait-on-in-progress-xmax.md` (accepted).
      - Implemented:
        - 1. `executor/operators_storage.go:epqWait`: re-enabled `WaitForXID(ctx.Ctx, xmax)`
          between WFG cycle check and snapshot refresh. All 4 call sites verified to
          unpin/unlock before calling epqWait (lines 923-924, 1159-1160, 1333-1334, 1520-1521).
          Context cancellation (connection close, timeout) handled via commitCond.Broadcast.
        - 2. `testport/framework/isolation.go`: Added `SessionTeardown` field; fixed teardown
          parser to separate global teardown from per-session teardown (was overwriting TeardownSQL).
        - 3. `testport/framework/isolation_runner.go`: Session-aware wait before sending next step
          for a session with a pending goroutine (prevents dual-goroutine connection conflicts);
          per-session teardown now runs after final drain and includes formatted output; reduced
          drainWindow 30s→5s; added execConnCapture; isolated context timeout to 10 min.
        - 4. `testport/isolation_port_test.go`: context timeout 2m→10m for 24-permutation specs.
      - Verified: TestPort_IsolationInsertConflictDoNothing PASS; TestPort_IsolationLockCommittedUpdate
        runs in 7.36s (was >600s hang) and produces `<waiting ...>` output (deferred on value
        mismatch due to advisory-lock snapshot refresh issue, separate from epqWait). All unit
        tests -race clean.

- [x] **M0100-0004**
      - Summary: EvalPlanQual concurrent UPDATE recheck (chain-following). (2026-05-13)
      - Design doc: `docs/design/0100-0004-evalplanqual-recheck.md` (accepted).
      - Implemented:
        - 1. `executor/operators_storage.go`: `epqFollowHOT(ctx, rel, blk, slot, cols, pred)` helper —
          follows HOT chain from old slot to latest visible version, re-evaluates WHERE.
        - 2. UPDATE SeqScan EPQ loop: after WaitForXID, if tuple invisible (committed):
          follow HOT chain, re-evaluate WHERE+SET, continue loop with new slot. RR → 40001.
        - 3. UPDATE IndexViaUpdate EPQ loop: same chain-following logic.
        - 4. DELETE EPQ loop: chain-follow + re-evaluate WHERE, delete latest version. RR → 40001.
        - 5. `executor/operators_ddl.go`: DROP TABLE now drops partition children unconditionally
          and inheritance children with CASCADE; `dropTableByRef` helper extracts drop logic.
      - All unit tests (executor/server/mvcc) pass with -race; TestPort_IsolationInsertConflictDoNothing PASS.
      - NOTE: eval-plan-qual/merge-match-recheck defer due to missing RETURNING support in planner
        (not an EPQ issue — RETURNING is parsed but not planned; needs separate work).

- [ ] **M0100-0005**
      - Summary: E2E pass confirmation: all 21 dedicated RC isolation
        tests pass. **Closes M0096-0005 and M0096-0013 via cross-reference.**
      - **Depends**: Close of M0107
      - Run: `go test -v -run TestPort_Isolation -timeout 30m ./internal/testport/`.
      - DoD: every `TestPort_Isolation*` listed in M0096-0001 reports `pass`
        (none `defer`, none `excluded`). On completion:
      - Mark M0096-0005 `[x]` with note "closed via M0100-0002".
      - Mark M0096-0013 `[x]` with note "closed via M0100-0005 — all 21
        dedicated isolation tests pass."
        Flip the 21 specs in `docs/test-port/executable-isolation-tests.md`
        from `status=defer` to `status=port`, `pass_required=yes`.
      - Update milestone doc 0100 status to `accepted`; update the
        `docs/milestones/README.md` index row to `accepted`.
      - Historical loop-by-loop progress notes archived to completed_milestones/m0100-0005-progress-log.md

        - **Remaining gaps (2026-05-22)**: 16 PASS, 6 SKIP. Each remaining test
          requires a design doc under `docs/design/` before implementation
          begins. Follow the pattern `0100-NNNN-<slug>.md` and update
          `docs/design/README.md` in the same commit.

        - [ ] **M0100-0006 — InsertConflictSpecconflict: speculative insertion for ON CONFLICT**
              - Summary: `TestPort_IsolationInsertConflictSpecconflict` SKIP —
                first divergence at L49 after UPSERT NOTICE-count fixes.
              - Root cause: goopg writes btree index entries only after the
                arbiter expression returns (`applyInsert`), so concurrent
                sessions that wake from an advisory-lock wait do not see each
                other's unconfirmed entries. PostgreSQL's "speculative
                insertion" writes the index entry *before* evaluating the
                arbiter expression, so waiters find in-progress conflicts.
                Without this, s1's upsert completes immediately after
                controller_unlock_1_3 (no conflict found) instead of waiting
                for s2's in-progress xact. This also causes missing NOTICE
                lines at L49–L50 (s1 arbiter re-evaluation after wake).
              - Required: restructure upsertOp to insert a speculative btree
                entry before arbiter evaluation, and either confirm it on
                success or remove it on conflict. Write a design doc first.

        - [ ] **M0100-0007 — MergeUpdate: MERGE RETURNING old/new aliases + merge_action()**
              - Summary: `TestPort_IsolationMergeUpdate` SKIP — `ERROR: column
                "old" does not exist`.
              - Root cause: MERGE RETURNING supports `old` and `new` as
                implicit composite aliases for the pre-action and post-action
                row, plus `merge_action()` to return the action kind
                (`INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE`). Neither is implemented.
              - Required: (a) parser recognition of `old`/`new` in MERGE
                RETURNING context, (b) planner resolution mapping them to the
                target-table column set with old/new semantics, (c) executor
                population of old/new values in `mergeOp.collectReturningRow`,
                (d) `merge_action()` function. Write a design doc first.

        - [x] **M0100-0008 — MergeJoin: MERGE EXPLAIN plan-tree parity**
              - COMPLETE (loop 13 + loop 14, commits 9b915fad): EXPLAIN MERGE
                block stripping in isolation runner + CTID stamping in
                mergeApplyUpdate resolved the EXPLAIN mismatch. The plan-tree
                and row-count now match. `TestPort_IsolationMergeJoin` PASS.
                **PASS count = 17** (adds LockCommittedUpdate, LockCommittedKeyupdate
                via M0115-0004 hint-bit fix in loop 14; MergeJoin already PASS from
                loop 13). Current PASS: ReadWriteUnique, LockCommittedUpdate,
                LockCommittedKeyupdate, InsertConflictDoUpdate{,2,3,4},
                InsertConflictDoNothing, FkSnapshot, PartitionKeyUpdate{1,2,3,4},
                MergeDelete, MergeInsertUpdate, MergeMatchRecheck, MergeJoin.

                **M0100-0009 (loop 1) — PASS count = 18**: DropIndexConcurrently1
                added. `WaitForOlderSlotsToCommit` implemented in `mvcc.Manager`;
                `execDropIndex` calls it when `Concurrent==true`. Parser now sets
                `DropIndexStmt.Concurrent`. Current PASS: ReadWriteUnique,
                LockCommittedUpdate, LockCommittedKeyupdate,
                InsertConflictDoUpdate{,2,3,4}, InsertConflictDoNothing, FkSnapshot,
                PartitionKeyUpdate{1,2,3,4}, MergeDelete, MergeInsertUpdate,
                MergeMatchRecheck, MergeJoin, DropIndexConcurrently1.

        - [x] **M0100-0009 — DropIndexConcurrently1: CONCURRENTLY two-phase wait semantics**
              - Summary: `TestPort_IsolationDropIndexConcurrently1` SKIP —
                missing `<waiting ...>` on the DROP step; subsequent SELECT
                returns 0 rows instead of 2.
              - Root cause: `execDropIndex` does not implement CONCURRENTLY
                semantics. `DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY` must (1) wait for all
                pre-existing transactions that could see the index, (2) mark
                the index as invalid in the catalog, (3) wait for all
                transactions that could see the invalid index, (4) physically
                drop the index. Goopg drops the index immediately without any
                wait, so a concurrent prepared statement loses access to the
                index mid-execution.
              - Required: implement two-phase drop with transaction-wait
                semantics. Additional planner gap: redundant sort-key
                elimination (`Sort Key: id, data` vs `Sort Key: id`).
                Write a design doc first.

        - [ ] **M0100-0010 — EvalPlanQual: EPQ recheck NOTICE parity**
              - Summary: `TestPort_IsolationEvalPlanQual` SKIP — first
                divergence at L411: NOTICE content differs (`lock_id: text
                checking = text checking: t` vs `upid: text savings = text
                checking: f`). Output: 1281 lines vs 1494 expected.
              - Root cause: the EPQ re-evaluation path in UPDATE/DELETE
                produces different comparison results from PostgreSQL. The
                `noisy_oper` PL/pgSQL function's side effects diverge,
                suggesting the EPQ chain-following, snapshot refresh, or
                trigger evaluation differs from upstream semantics.
              - Required: trace the EPQ code paths in goopg against PG's
                `ExecUpdate`/`ExecDelete` EPQ loops, align NOTICE output
                ordering and content. Write a design doc first.

        - [ ] **M0100-0011 — EvalPlanQualTrigger: EPQ trigger output parity**
              - Summary: `TestPort_IsolationEvalPlanQualTrigger` SKIP — first
                divergence at L13: expected column headers `key|data` but
                got `step s1_ins_b: INSERT INTO trigtest ...`. Output: 2185
                lines vs 2733 expected (548 missing).
              - Root cause: trigger bodies in EPQ-rechecked UPDATE/DELETE
                paths either do not fire or produce output at different
                points in the execution flow. BEFORE/AFTER trigger NOTICE
                emission and step-header ordering differ from PG.
              - Required: trace trigger execution during EPQ rechecks,
                ensure BEFORE/AFTER triggers fire at correct points and
                output appears at the expected positions. Write a design
                doc first.

### Stale notes carried from M0096-0013 (do NOT re-implement)

The following two residuals were verified non-gaps during M0100 planning;
do not modify these sites in M0100. Re-open as new sub-milestones only
if 21-spec pass surfaces a real divergence:

- RAISE NOTICE from trigger bodies — already correctly merged from child
  → parent context at `internal/executor/plpgsql_runtime.go:1053-1056`
  (M0096-0012).
- `---+---` column alignment width in `pqprintFormat`
  (`internal/testport/framework/isolation_runner.go:285-355`) — already
  matches libpq `PQprint` align-mode (`widths[i] = max(header_len,
  max_data_len)`); no width-derivation bug.

## M0102 — Heterogeneous Streaming-Replication + SIGKILL-Failover E2E (filed 2026-05-13)

  - [x] **M0102-0008**
      - Summary: Close milestone.
      - Add four rows to `docs/test-port/postgres-oracle-port-status.csv`:
        `e2e-failover-pg-to-goopg-async`, `e2e-failover-pg-to-goopg-sync`,
        `e2e-failover-goopg-to-pg-async`, `e2e-failover-goopg-to-pg-sync` — all
        at `status=port`, `pass_required=yes`. Regenerate the `.md` via
        `go run ./cmd/gen-oracle-port-status`. Flip
        `docs/milestones/0102-heterogeneous-replication-failover-e2e.md` status
        to `accepted` and update the `docs/milestones/README.md` index row.
      - Mark all 5 design docs (`0102-0001..-0005`) as `accepted`. Run the
        regression suites listed in the milestone DoD and confirm zero
        regressions.

 - [ ] **M0102-0009** (follow-up to M0102-0008)
      - Summary: `/sync_remote_apply` still fails at "physical
        replication did not reach streaming state within 45s"

 - [ ] **M0102-0010** (follow-up to M0102-0008)
      - Summary: 15 initdb test failures

## M0110 — Additional TAP Test Porting (beyond M0094/M0095) (filed 2026-05-22)

Operational note (2026-05-22):
- This milestone covers TAP tests listed in
  `docs/test-port/upstream-tap-coverage.md` that are **not** in scope for
  M0094 (recovery + subscription) or M0095 (basebackup / checksums /
  controldata / pg_ctl / walsummary / scripts).
- Already-ported families (psql, pgbench, initdb) are listed for
  completeness at the bottom; no new work is needed.
- Excluded tests that exercise a PG client tool against a goopg server
  are included because they validate the wire-protocol and SQL
  compatibility surface.  Tests for tools that do not connect to a
  server (pg_config, pg_test_fsync, pg_test_timing) or that require
  multi-server orchestration (pg_rewind, pg_upgrade, pg_combinebackup)
  remain excluded.
- Each test is tagged with one of:
  - **SHOULD_PASS** — goopg feature is implemented; test is expected to
    pass once ported to Go and any remaining normalization is applied.
  - **BUG_FIX** — feature is implemented but has known bugs that would
    prevent the test from passing.
  - **UNIMPLEMENTED** — required feature is not yet implemented.

### pg_dump (6 tests — excluded → candidate)

pg_dump connects to a live server and issues SQL queries to extract
schema and data.  Porting these tests validates goopg's catalog views,
information_schema, pg_depend, extension infrastructure, and large-
object support.

- [ ] **M0110-0001 — Port pg_dump TAP tests**
      - Target tests:
        | Test | Status | Rationale |
        |------|--------|-----------|
        | `postgres/src/bin/pg_dump/t/001_basic.pl` | UNIMPLEMENTED | Requires pg_dump binary; tests --help/--version and basic dump of a running server. |
        | `postgres/src/bin/pg_dump/t/002_pg_dump.pl` | UNIMPLEMENTED | Comprehensive schema/object dump; requires full catalog parity (pg_class, pg_attribute, pg_type, pg_proc, pg_depend, pg_extension, etc.). |
        | `postgres/src/bin/pg_dump/t/003_pg_dump_with_server.pl` | UNIMPLEMENTED | Dump+restore round-trip against a live server; exercises SQL-level object creation and data restoration. |
        | `postgres/src/bin/pg_dump/t/004_pg_dump_parallel.pl` | UNIMPLEMENTED | Parallel dump; additionally requires multi-connection catalog snapshot consistency. |
        | `postgres/src/bin/pg_dump/t/005_pg_dump_filterfile.pl` | UNIMPLEMENTED | Filter-file support in pg_dump. |
        | `postgres/src/bin/pg_dump/t/010_dump_connstr.pl` | UNIMPLEMENTED | Connection-string handling in pg_dump. |
      - Action: design doc first; estimate the catalog surface required per
        test; start with 001 and 003 (basic server round-trip).  Most tests
        are blocked on catalog-view coverage (pg_class, pg_attribute,
        pg_type, pg_proc, pg_depend, pg_extension).

### pg_waldump (2 tests — excluded → candidate)

pg_waldump reads WAL segment files directly (no server connection).
Porting validates goopg's WAL record format compatibility with upstream.

- [ ] **M0110-0002 — Port pg_waldump TAP tests**
      - Target tests:
        | Test | Status | Rationale |
        |------|--------|-----------|
        | `postgres/src/bin/pg_waldump/t/001_basic.pl` | BUG_FIX | goopg WAL format is PG-compatible (M0014, M0101), but edge cases (record alignment, continuation records, cross-segment records) may differ. |
        | `postgres/src/bin/pg_waldump/t/002_save_fullpage.pl` | UNIMPLEMENTED | `pg_waldump --save-fullpage` requires full-page-image extraction; goopg may not emit FPI in all the same places as PG. |
      - Action: port 001 first; triage against a fresh goopg WAL segment;
        fix WAL format gaps discovered.

### pg_amcheck (5 tests — excluded → candidate)

pg_amcheck connects to a server and runs heap/btree corruption checks.
Porting validates goopg's heap page and btree index integrity
functions (e.g. `bt_index_parent_check`, `verify_heapam`).

- [ ] **M0110-0003 — Port pg_amcheck TAP tests**
      - Target tests:
        | Test | Status | Rationale |
        |------|--------|-----------|
        | `postgres/src/bin/pg_amcheck/t/001_basic.pl` | UNIMPLEMENTED | Basic --help/--version + connection check. |
        | `postgres/src/bin/pg_amcheck/t/002_nonesuch.pl` | UNIMPLEMENTED | Handles non-existent database/relation. |
        | `postgres/src/bin/pg_amcheck/t/003_check.pl` | UNIMPLEMENTED | Runs actual heap/btree corruption checks against a server. |
        | `postgres/src/bin/pg_amcheck/t/004_verify_heapam.pl` | UNIMPLEMENTED | `verify_heapam()` function required (not in goopg). |
        | `postgres/src/bin/pg_amcheck/t/005_opclass_damage.pl` | UNIMPLEMENTED | Operator-class damage detection; requires opclass system catalog parity. |
      - Action: all blocked on `verify_heapam()` SRF + opclass catalog
        coverage.  Low priority; revisit when system catalog maturity
        increases and the pg_dump tests pass.

### pg_resetwal (2 tests — excluded → candidate)

pg_resetwal resets the WAL and control file of a non-running cluster.
Porting validates goopg's pg_control and WAL segment layout on disk.

- [ ] **M0110-0004 — Port pg_resetwal TAP tests**
      - Target tests:
        | Test | Status | Rationale |
        |------|--------|-----------|
        | `postgres/src/bin/pg_resetwal/t/001_basic.pl` | UNIMPLEMENTED | Requires pg_resetwal binary; validates control-file reading and WAL reset. |
        | `postgres/src/bin/pg_resetwal/t/002_corrupted.pl` | UNIMPLEMENTED | Simulates corrupted WAL and verifies pg_resetwal recovery behaviour. |
      - Action: depends on pg_control byte-level compatibility (M0106).
        Port 001 to validate goopg's control file can be parsed by upstream
        pg_resetwal.

### pg_verifybackup (10 tests — excluded → no action)

pg_verifybackup validates a base backup's manifest and file integrity.
These tests are NOT included because they depend on pg_basebackup
output, which is already covered by M0095-0003.  Once M0095-0003 is
complete, these can be re-evaluated.

### Already ported (not in M0094/M0095 — listed for completeness)

| Family | Tests | Port location | Status |
|--------|-------|--------------|--------|
| `initdb` | 1 (`001_initdb.pl`) | `internal/testport/tap_port_test.go` | port |
| `psql` | 3 (`001_basic.pl`, `010_tab_completion.pl`, `020_cancel.pl`) | `internal/testport/tap_port_test.go` | port |
| `pgbench` | 2 (`001_pgbench_with_server.pl`, `002_pgbench_no_server.pl`) | `internal/testport/tap_port_test.go` | port |

### Excluded with no action (not meaningful for goopg)

| Tool | Reason |
|------|--------|
| `pg_config` | Queries pg_config binary; no server interaction. |
| `pg_combinebackup` | Multi-server orchestration; requires pg_basebackup chains. |
| `pg_archivecleanup` | No server interaction. |
| `pg_rewind` | Requires standby/failover multi-server setup. |
| `pg_test_fsync` | No server interaction; filesystem benchmark. |
| `pg_test_timing` | No server interaction; timing benchmark. |
| `pg_upgrade` | Multi-server orchestration; pg_upgrade binary. |


## Notes

- This file is the authoritative TODO list for Ralph. Update it after every
  meaningful change.
- Keep work to ONE item per loop. Decompose further if an item is larger
  than what fits in a single agent invocation.
- Every non-trivial subsystem must land alongside (or just before) a design
  doc under `docs/design/`. The spec treats this as a hard requirement.
