# 0110-0001 — pg_dump TAP test port (001_basic)

Status: accepted (partial — 001_basic landed; 002–010 deferred)

## Context

`M0110-0001` ports the upstream `pg_dump` TAP suite
(`postgres/src/bin/pg_dump/t/`) into Go tests under `internal/testport/`.
The suite has six files (001, 002, 003, 004, 005, 010). They split cleanly into
two tiers by what they exercise:

| upstream file | exercises | goopg dependency |
|---|---|---|
| `001_basic.pl` | CLI option handling only | **none** — binary argument parser only |
| `002_pg_dump.pl` | comprehensive schema/object dump | full catalog-view parity |
| `003_pg_dump_with_server.pl` | dump+restore round-trip vs live server | catalog parity + SQL restore |
| `004_pg_dump_parallel.pl` | parallel dump | multi-connection snapshot consistency |
| `005_pg_dump_filterfile.pl` | `--filter` file support | catalog parity |
| `010_dump_connstr.pl` | connection-string handling | live server + catalog parity |

## Decision

Port `001_basic.pl` this loop; defer 002–010.

`001_basic.pl` is a pure command-line-handling test. Its upstream comment is
explicit: the invalid-option / disallowed-combination checks "Doesn't require a
PG instance to be set up". Every assertion is decided by the binary's argument
parser *before* any server connection is attempted. goopg reuses the upstream
`pg_dump` / `pg_restore` / `pg_dumpall` binaries (shipped in
`postgres/local_install/bin`) unchanged, so the port simply drives those
binaries and validates the CLI surface the rest of the test suite depends on.

### Port shape (`internal/testport/pgdump_port_test.go`)

- Reuses the existing `clientToolBin` / `runTool` helpers
  (`client_tools_port_test.go`).
- Adds three small helpers mirroring `PostgreSQL::Test::Utils`:
  `programHelpOk`, `programVersionOk`, `programOptionsHandlingOk`.
- `commandFailsContaining` mirrors `command_fails_like`: non-zero exit + a
  literal substring of the expected error in combined stdout/stderr. Upstream
  uses `qr/\Q…\E/` literal-quoted regexes whose payload is a fixed substring, so
  `strings.Contains` is faithful and avoids regex-escaping drift.
- The `HAVE_LIBZ`-conditional block is reproduced by **probing the binary's
  behaviour** (`pg_dump -Z 15` → "between 1 and 9" means zlib is present) rather
  than reading compile config, so the test self-adapts to either build.

Test function: `TestPort_PgDump001Basic`. CSV row `DU-001` → `port`,
`pass_required=yes`. The umbrella row `E-002` retains the deferred remainder.

## Connection-setup compatibility (enabler for 002–010)

Before pg_dump runs *any* catalog query it executes a fixed handshake in
`setup_connection()` (`postgres/src/bin/pg_dump/pg_dump.c`): a battery of `SET`
commands plus `SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ, READ ONLY` for a
consistent snapshot. An empirical probe (real `pg_dump --no-sync postgres`
against a live goopg server) showed goopg aborting this handshake before
reaching the first catalog query, so the catalog-parity work below was
unreachable. Two classes of gap were closed:

1. **Unregistered GUCs.** `synchronize_seqscans`, `transaction_timeout`
   (PG 17+) and `row_security` were not in the GUC registry, so the
   corresponding `SET` failed with `unrecognized configuration parameter`.
   Added as accepted no-ops in `internal/config/defaults.go` (boot defaults
   mirror `guc_tables.c`: on/0/on) + `postgresql.conf.sample` entries. goopg
   enforces none of them (no synchronized scans, no per-txn timeout, no RLS),
   but `SET` must succeed.
2. **`SET TRANSACTION` mis-routing.** The server's simple-query string
   fast-path (`internal/server/query.go`) matched the generic `SET ` prefix and
   handed `TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL …` to `handleSet`, which read
   `TRANSACTION` as a GUC name (`unrecognized configuration parameter
   "TRANSACTION"`). A new case routes `SET [LOCAL|SESSION] TRANSACTION …` and
   `SET SESSION CHARACTERISTICS …` through the parser-based executor, which
   already builds a `SetTransactionStmt` (M0096-0002) and applies the isolation
   level. The `"TRANSACTION "` trailing space distinguishes it from the
   `transaction_timeout` GUC. The parser's transaction-mode loop also now
   consumes the comma in `REPEATABLE READ, READ ONLY` (it previously stopped at
   the comma, leaving trailing tokens).

After this slice pg_dump completes `setup_connection()` and proceeds into its
catalog-dump phase. The next blocker is catalog-view parity: the first catalog
query `SELECT oid, rolname FROM pg_catalog.pg_roles ORDER BY 1` (getRoles) fails
because goopg's `pg_roles` view lacks an `oid` column — the start of the
DU-002+ catalog work below.

Regression guard: `TestPort_PgDumpConnectionSetup`
(`internal/testport/pgdump_connsetup_test.go`) drives real pg_dump and asserts
no `setup_connection()` error signature appears; it logs the remaining
catalog-parity blocker and auto-tightens to assert exit 0 once a clean dump
works. Unit guards: `config.TestPgDumpConnectionSetupGUCs`,
`parser.TestParseSetTransactionCommaSeparated`.

## Deferred (002–010) — catalog surface estimate

The remaining five tests all block on the same gap: a faithful schema dump
needs broad catalog-view parity. pg_dump issues a fixed battery of catalog
queries against `pg_class`, `pg_attribute`, `pg_type`, `pg_proc`, `pg_depend`,
`pg_namespace`, `pg_constraint`, `pg_index`, `pg_am`, `pg_collation`,
`pg_extension`, `pg_default_acl`, plus `format_type()`, `pg_get_*def()` helper
functions and `pg_catalog.set_config()`. 003 additionally needs SQL-level
restore (CREATE TABLE/INDEX/CONSTRAINT replay) to round-trip. These are tracked
under `M0110-0001` in `.ralph/fix_plan.md`; promote `E-002` rows to `port`
incrementally as the catalog surface lands (002 → schema dump, 003 → round-trip
first, per the fix_plan action).

## Verification

`go test -v -run TestPort_PgDump001Basic ./internal/testport/` → PASS.
`go test -v -run TestPort_PgDumpConnectionSetup ./internal/testport/` → PASS
(passes connection setup; logs the pg_roles.oid gap).
`go test ./internal/config/ ./internal/parser/ ./internal/server/` → PASS.
`go run ./cmd/gen-oracle-port-status` regenerates the status markdown.
